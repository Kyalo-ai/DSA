## 📚 Data Structures Implementation in Java
# 📌 Project Overview

__This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental Data Structures concepts.
Each data structure is implemented as a separate project with its own source code and documentation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate understanding of:

  1.Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

   2.Arrays




Each folder contains:

  -Java source files

  -Pseudocode

  -Explanation

  -Example outputs

## 🧠 Data Structures Included
# 🔹 1. Singly Linked List
Description

--A linear data structure where each node contains:

   .Data

  .Pointer to next node

--Operations Implemented:

1.Insert at beginning

2.Insert at end

3.Delete node

4.Traverse list

5.Display list


## 🔹 2. Doubly Linked List
Description

-Each node contains:

--Data

--Pointer to next node

---Pointer to previous node

# Features

Forward traversal

Backward traversal

Browser navigation simulation

## 🔹 3. Circular Linked List
Description

Last node points back to the head node.

## Features

1.Circular traversal

2.Insert at beginning

3.Insert at end

4.Delete first node

5.Display circular structure

# Use Case

-Used in scheduling systems and round-robin algorithms.

## 🔹 4. Round Robin Scheduling (Circular Linked List Based)
Description

Implements CPU scheduling using:

1.Time Quantum

2.Burst Time

3.R3.emaining Time

4.Circular ready queue

## Features

-Process insertion

-Process deletion

-Round Robin execution

-Process reset

--Total execution time tracking

# Algorithm Concept

Each process runs for a fixed time quantum.
If not finished, it goes to the back of the queue.

# 🔹 5. Array Implementation
Description

Basic array-based data structure demonstrating:

1.insertion
